                                        We use the information we have to verify accounts and activity, combat harmful conduct, detect and prevent spam and other bad experiences, maintain the integrity of our Services, and promote safety and security on Mafindoor Services.

                                We provide you with the ability to access, rectify, port and erase your data. We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our Services, or until your account is deleted - whichever comes first. When you delete your account, we delete your basic information and activities, and you won't be able to recover that information later.
                            </p>

                                We'll notify you before we make changes to this policy and give you the opportunity to review the revised policy before you choose to continue using our Services.
